                                     do_reset, do_id_query) 

	Purpose: Open an instance of an instrument object for remote communication
		 over LAN/Ethernet.

    Parameters:
    my_socket - Instance of a socket object.

		ip_address (string) - The TCP/IP address string associated with the
                                      target instrument. 
		my_port (int) - The instrument connection port.

		timeout (int) - The timeout limit for query/communication exchanges.

		do_reset (int) - Determines whether the instrument is to be reset
		                 upon connection to the instrument. Setting to 1
                         will perform the reset; setting to zero avoids it.

		do_clear (int) - Determines whether the instrument is to be cleared


        do_id_query (int) - Determines when the instrument is to echo its
                            identification string after it is initialized. 

	Returns:
		my_socket - Updated instance of a socket object that includes
                            attributes of a valid connection. 

	Revisions:

	This example application demonstrates the use of the DAQ6510 in a switching
	only application. The channel control reflects the use of the Model 7701 
	multiplexer card. The setup assumes the following:
	    A. A power source is applied to MUX2 and routed to any of three devices
	       connected to channels 117, 118, and 119.
	    B. A measurement device is applied to MUX1 and routed to any of six possible
	       test points connected to channels 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, and 106. 
	    C. The jumpers between MUX1 and the DMM Input terminals and those between 
	       MUX2 and the DMM Sense terminals have been removed from the Model 7701. 
	       However, relays 34 and 35 are forced to their open state to help ensure
	       isolation.
	    D. For each MUX2 source connection to the device, each of the six MUX1
	       channels will be closed to allow for a measurement to occur then
	       open to allow for subsequent channel measurements.
